What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The hidden directory ".git" gets created. I need to do it for git, so it can start tracking all the changes in the repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory contains all our files. Repository contains all our commits (if any). Staging area is a transition environment where we put the file(s)/changes we want to commit.
